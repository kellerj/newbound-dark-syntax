# UCD Admin IT dark syntax theme for Atom

Credit: forked from [newbound dark](https://atom.io/themes/newbound-dark-syntax) with help from selectors borrowed from [pubster-syntax](https://atom.io/themes/pubster-syntax)

This is a subtle, medium contrast theme for [Atom](https://atom.io), based on the hues and shades from [Oliver Pattisonâ€™s website](https://olivermak.es). Optimized for writing Markdown and front-end development, it should also work for general use.

- Support for UIs that are responsive to hues from syntax themes, like the built-in [One Dark UI theme](https://atom.io/themes/one-dark-ui)
- Subtle `invisibles` (if enabled in Settings)
- Bracket matching style
- Suitable for monospace fonts without an italic variant
